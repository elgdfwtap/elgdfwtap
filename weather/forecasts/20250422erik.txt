      "text": "Showers likely tonight north of Champaign from around 8PM to 3AM tomorrow on I-57. Some pockets of higher supercell probability of SCP=4 around Iowa. Good moisture and shear for tornados, and higher cape moving in from the west into the Chicago area. (Figure 1) Stronger pockets of supercell conditions in central Kansas around 8PM. (Figure 2) However, I don't think it's likely to produce tornados since there is a lack of strong storms, mostly weak messy precipitation, implied by low lightning density across the forecast area, except for some possibly stronger cells in Kansas.",

      "text": "Showers across Iowa and northern Illinois today. More probable are some medium-intensity cells forming in Iowa in the early morning hours of Wednesday, around midnight. Later in the day, more favorable conditions for supercells around southern Nebraska to central Kansas, stretching to northern Wisconsin. Tornados most probable around north central Kansas, Southeastern Nebraska, and Northeastern Wisconsin. (Figure 1) The highest MUCape is in Kansas, with most of the state above 1000 J/kg. Strong thunderstorms are likely in this area, perhaps some with rotation. (Figure 2) However, the 0-3 km cape is limited for much of this area, so tornadic potetial is more limited. 0-3 km cape is higher in Wisconsin, where I expect there to be potential for small tornados. Larger tornados, however, are inibited by a lack of strong storms.(Figure 3) The area west of Kansas City should expect a high likelihood for severe thunderstorms, expected to pop around 3 PM and lasting until 2AM the next morning.",
