The high today will be around 70 degrees and will occur at 5PM, and the low will be 45 degrees at 6AM tomorrow morning. Supercell formation likely in Texas today as a line storms forms in the west of the state and tracks east, likely picking up some rotation along the way (Figure 2). Severe thunderstorms capable of producing hail and winds are likely, but no tornado as there is a lack of CAPE in the lower levels (Figure 3). These thunderstorms are likely to merge into much larger systems later tonight into early next morning, and give a lot of precipitation to north Texas, and bring rain to Oklahoma and Arkansas into Saturday and Sunday.",

      "text": "As the trough moves up on Monday it picks up a strong lower level jet with up to 60 knots of bulk shear (Figure 1) and a lot of moisture (Figure 2), and a severe weather event \tis highly likely (Figure 3). The supercell risk appears to peak near 7PM. It brings with it a high likelyhood of significant tornados (Figure 4), some areas near Des Moines up to STP=6.1, likely causing a tornado outbreak in Iowa and Kansas, and perhaps parts of Missouri. This outbreak is capable of producing large violent tornados. I have never seen the STP this high before. A lot of potential energy (Figure 5) and a good cap, strong but not too strong to inhibit storm formation (Figure 6) will cause high energy storms which explode into the jet stream and begin rotating with a powerful updraft, and are isolated enough to have unrestrained powerful mesocyclones. Furthermore, strong cape near the surface (Figure 7) will lead to the formation of large violent tornados at the bottoms of these swirling updrafts. The storms are likely to start around mid afternoon, around 7 PM, and continue late into the night.",
